# Space Invaders

the control script for a working [Space Invaders arcade cabinet in Space Engineers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3159106410)

Controls:
use A and D to move. Space to shoot.

this was mostly a good excuse to see if i could get some raster image manipulation working. it uses some raster sprite intersection detection and specifically the highlighting to delete the intersected pixels in the barriers.
